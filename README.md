# tourismandco

A example Flutter app used for teaching [this fluttercrashcourse.com course](https://fluttercrashcourse.com/courses/tourismco), displaying a list of interesting locations you can visit as a tourist. Tapping on a list item shows a nice detail page where you can book the tour.

This repo is basically a copy of [lesson18](https://github.com/seenickcode/fluttercrashcourse-lessons/tree/master/module02-tourismandco/lesson18), the last lesson of the course mentioned above.
